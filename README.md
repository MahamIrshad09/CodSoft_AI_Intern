# Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax

This project is a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe where you can play against an unbeatable AI opponent. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to ensure it makes the best possible moves. This project serves as a practical example of game theory and basic search algorithms.

## Features

- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against a sophisticated AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm.
- Enjoy a challenging game where the AI ensures a win, loss, or tie outcome.
- A simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the game 
4. The game will open in a GUI window. Click on the cells to make your moves.

5. Try to beat the AI, but be prepared for a challenging opponent!

## Acknowledgments

- The Minimax algorithm and game theory concepts used in this project are inspired by principles discussed in artificial intelligence courses and textbooks.
- The project structure and game interface are implemented using the Tkinter library for Python.

Have fun playing Tic-Tac-Toe against the unbeatable AI! If you encounter any issues or have ideas for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or contribute to the project.

# Rule-Based ChatBot

## What Is This?

This is a simple chatbot that can have text conversations with you. It can answer questions, provide information, and engage in simple chats. But here's the trick: it responds based on a set of predefined rules. Think of it like a chatbot with a script - it has answers for certain questions.

## How to Use It

Get the Code: First, you need to get the chatbot's code onto your computer. You can do this by clicking the "Clone or Download" button and then selecting "Download ZIP." Once it's downloaded, unzip the file.

Run the ChatBot: To start chatting with the bot, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where the chatbot code is located, and run it by typing python chatbot.py and pressing Enter.

Talk to the ChatBot: A graphical window will pop up. You can type your questions or messages into the text box and click the "Send" button. The chatbot will respond based on its predefined rules.

Customize Responses: If you want to make the chatbot say different things, you can change the predefined rules in the code. Look for the rules dictionary, and you can add your own questions and answers.
rules = {
    "hello": ["Hi there!", "Hello!", "Hey!"],
    "how are you": ["I'm just a computer program, but I'm doing well. How can I help you?"],
    # Add more rules and responses here
}
## What Can I Use It For?

This project is a basic introduction to chatbots and how they can respond to user questions. It doesn't understand language like humans do but can be a good starting point to learn about chatbot development and get a grasp of how they work.

# Movie Recommendation System

This is a simple movie recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering to suggest movies to users based on their preferences.
## Introduction

Recommendation systems are widely used in today's applications to provide personalized suggestions to users. This project showcases how to build a basic movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering. It calculates movie recommendations for users based on their ratings and the similarity of movie preferences among users.

## Features

- Collaborative filtering-based movie recommendations.
- Use your own dataset or customize the system to suit your needs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
Install the required dependencies (you may need to install scikit-learn and pandas if not already installed):
pip install scikit-learn pandas

3. Replace the sample dataset with your own dataset in the project directory.

4. Run the Python script:
   
python recommendation_system.py
## Usage

Customize the user_ratings list in recommendation_system.py to provide sample user ratings and get movie recommendations based on those ratings.

## Dataset
You can use your own movie dataset, or you can use the provided sample dataset. The sample dataset includes movie ratings and information about movies.
